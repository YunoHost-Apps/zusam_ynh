### Status

The project has the goal of being really stable for the backend once 1.0 is hit. That means no database structure changes, an update system and a stable API.
The webapp can still change a lot after that point.
For now, Zusam is completely usable in a day-to-day basis but is subject to significative evolutions with upcoming updates and doesn't guarantee backwards compatibility.
